It is impossible to use a username like _boyang_, _bo.yang_, etc, in many situations because these names are already occupied by other _Yang Bo_ s. I use _"b0yan9"_ in many cases because it looks like _"boyang"_. 

[Chinese name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_name) places the family name at first, followed by the given name. Normally, the family name consists of one or two charactes and the given name consists of one or two characters. So in most cases, Chinese names are 2 to 4 charactes. Acutally, names consisting 3 characters (1 character family name and 2 characters given name) are the most prevalent. My family name is 杨 in simiplified Chinese or 楊 in traditional Chinese. My given name is 博 in both the simiplified Chinese and traditional Chinese. The [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) is _yáng bó_. It's fine to call me _Bo_ or _Bo Yang_ or _Yang Bo_, and it does not matter if you cannot pronounce it precisely.
