My name is 杨 (yáng) 博 (bó). [Chinese name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_name) places the family name at first, followed by the given name. Normally, the family name consists of one or two charactes and the given name consists of one or two characters. It's fine to call me _Bo_ or _Bo Yang_ or _Yang Bo_. 

More information about characters [杨\|楊](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%A5%8A) and [博](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8D%9A).
