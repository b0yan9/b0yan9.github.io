My name is 杨 (yáng) 博 (bó). [Chinese name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_name) places the family name at first, followed by the given name. Normally, the family name consists of one or two charactes and the given name consists of one or two characters. It's fine to call me _Bo_ or _Bo Yang_ or _Yang Bo_, and it does not matter if you cannot pronounce it precisely. 

It is impossible to use a username like _boyang_, _bo.yang_, etc, in many situations because these names are already used by other _Yang Bo_ s. I use _"b0yan9"_ because it looks like _"boyang"_.
